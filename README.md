# RSBlox
Wine prefix manager for Roblox, made in Rust
## NOTE:
As of May 3, 2023, Roblox does not support Wine anymore.

If you want to play Roblox on Linux, you need to install it through Waydroid. More info on that [here.](https://gitlab.com/TestingPlant/roblox-on-waydroid-guide)


This repository will remain open, as [Roblox plans to allow Wine users to play again in the future.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/28)
